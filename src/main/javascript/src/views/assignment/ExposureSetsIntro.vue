      Because you have <strong>{{ this.numExposureSets }} exposure sets</strong>,
      you’ll need to include a minimum of <strong>{{ this.numExposureSets }} assignments</strong> in this experiment,
      one for each set.
      <br><br>
      Let’s create your assignments now.

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to include more assignments, you should try to have the same number of assignments in each exposure set for a balanced experiment. Once we've got everything setup, you'll have an opportunity to specify experimental outcomes (such as test performance, attendance, or other data) separately for each of the exposures. </p>
